Welcome to jackknify's documentation!
=====================================

`jackknify` is a Python library used to create noise realizations of radio/mm interferometry data.

The package was developed to make realistic noise maps, which are usefull for feasibillity studies, as to better understand the false likelihood of detecting weak spectral lines. 

The package has been tested and used for ALMA data but the technique is broadly applicable to any interferometric data s.

To get started, checkout the :doc:`install` page.
