Installation
============

`jacked` can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jacked

Alternatively, install using GitHub

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Joshiwavm/jacked

Or directly from the source

.. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/Joshiwavm/jacked
        cd jacked
        pip install -e .

`jacked` runs in python3.6 because it uses ``casatasks`` and ``casatools``
